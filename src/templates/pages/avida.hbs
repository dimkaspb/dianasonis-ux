          In 2015, I was approached to provide UX Strategy for a senior living community being built in Florida. While the initial scope was to provide digital strategy - given the physical nature of the community - service design came to play a large role in final recommendations. This is the story of how I helped build a bridge between business needs and user insights to come up with a strategic roadmap two years into the future.

          Great customer experience doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It’s a direct overlap between business goals and target audience needs. Finding this intersection is the key to a great on- or offline experience, but this isn’t done in a vacuum either. Understanding context, and capitalizing on opportunities missed by the competition, is what will push customer experience ahead and ultimately contribute to the bottom line.

The client - a private equity group - approached us with two primary objectives - to evaluate the role of digital products/services for the planned senior living community sub-brand and to identify how these fit into their larger parent brand.
        </p>
        <p>
This was a pure research & strategy project since the building site didn’t break ground yet. With this being the client’s first foray into the senior living space and no physical community site present, we were truly starting from zero.

          We began by aligning on client goals and requirements across all elements of the project. Having a solid understanding of business goals, in addition to advocating for the target audience, goes a long way in moving the project along to its desired target.
        </p>
        <p>
          After identifying primary & secondary business objectives, budget, and the planned community’s physical building timeline, we looked into the various target audience groups and competitors to propose a vision for what a great customer experience is for a senior living community. I used a trusty Venn diagram to communicate to the client how all these pieces fit together.
